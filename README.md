Sabermetrics Baseball Stats Web Scraping

For this project, I used web scraping techniques to pull data for the National League West and Japan's Central League for the year 2022. I put them into one dataframe using Python. I implemented a Sabermetrics statistic on the data, creating a new column. I then used visualizations and analysis to compare the two leagues.
